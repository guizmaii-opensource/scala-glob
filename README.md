# scala-glob

This library allows one to check paths against file system glob
patterns.

It doesn't provides methods for walking the filesystem looking
for entries matching a given pattern, though you could write
them easily on top of this library.

Actually this library is an spin-off from my other library
[spark-hugefs](github.com/salva/spark-hugefs) where it is used
just for that.

## Example

```scala
import com.github.salva.scala.glob.{Glob, Match, NoMatch}

val g = new Glob("foo/bar/**.jp{,e}g", caseInsensitive=true)

val path = "foo/bar/doz//brum/image100.JPG"

g.matches(path) match {
  case NoMatch => { /* no match */ }
  case Match(_) => println(s"$path matches $g")
}
```

## Usage

`Glob` objects provide two main methods, `matches` and `matchesPartially`.
Both take a path and return one of the following values:

  * `NoMatch`: the glob pattern doesn't match the given path.

  * `Matches(dirRequired:Boolean)`: the glob pattern does match the
    given path. The `dirRequired` flag indicates where the glob pattern
    requires the path to be a directory.
     
    For instance, the object `Glob("/foo/")` will match `"/foo"`
    and `"/foo/"` but because of the slash at the end of the pattern,
    it sets the `dirRequired` flag to true in the result. On the other
    hand, `Glob("/foo")` returns `Match(false)`.

`matchesPartially` returns whether the given path matches a fragment of
the glob pattern. For instance `Glob("/foo/bar")` will match sucesfully
patterns `"/"` and `"/foo"` but not `"/foo/bar"` as it is a full
match.

The `Glob` constructor accepts the following optional argument flags:

  * `caseInsensitive`: indicates whether the matchings should be
    performed in a case-insensitive way.
     
  * `period`: Indicates whether wildcard characters inside the glob
    pattern can match period characters (`.`) at the beginning of
    directory names.
    
    For instance, by default, `Glob("*")` will not match `".foo"` but
     `Glob("*", period=true)` will do it.
     
    Note that in any case, directories `"."` and `".."` are never
    matched.
 
The set of wildcards actually supported are as follows:

  * `?`: matches any character.
  
  * `*`: matches any character sequence but does not cross directory
    boundaries.
    
  * `**`: matches any sequence of characters and may cross directory
    boundaries. For instance, some valid usages are `"foo**bar`,
    `foo/**bar`, `foo**/bar` and `foo/**/bar` (note that in this last case, `/**/`
    may match zero or more directory levels).
    
  * `[abc...]`, `[a-z...]`:  matches any character in the given class.
  
  * `[!a...]`: matches any character outside of the given class.
  
  * `{...,..., ... }`: matches any sequence of characters matching the
    subpatterns listed inside the curly brackets separated by commas.
    
  * `\ `: escapes the following character. For instance `\?` matches
    the question mark.  
  
As a general guideline, `scala-glob` mimics the globing support in
[`bash`](https://www.gnu.org/savannah-checkouts/gnu/bash/manual/bash.html#Filename-Expansion),
with the `globstar` extension. In principle, any deviation from there is
considered a bug, though there may be some corner cases where it would
be imposible to behave in the same way as bash without accesing the file
system.

## Limitations

So far, only UNIX style paths are supported. It may probably also work
for Windows paths once you replace the backslash separators (`\ `) by the
forward ones (`/`).

## Support

Bug reports, feature requests and pathes can be submitted using the
regular GitHub [tools](https://github.com/salva/scala-glob).

For questions about the module usage, I would much prefer
then to be posted in a public forum as 
[StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/).
That way they would also become visible to others facing similar
issues in the future. Though, fell free to notify me about then
once posted by email (sfandino@yahoo.com).
